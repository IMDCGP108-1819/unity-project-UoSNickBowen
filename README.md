// Please note that due to the cap at 100 files on Github, I had to upload the contents of "Assets" seperately.
// If this is an issue, please make a file called "Assignment 1", with a subfile called "Assets".
// Drag Packages and ProjectSettings into the Assignment 1 file, and everything except "Assignment 1 2D Game Build", "Assignment 1 Unity Bibliography" and "Waltz of the Flowers" into the subfile "Assets".
// Sorry for the inconvenience! It's just that Github is very foreign to me!
